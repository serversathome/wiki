# What is Immich Drop?

Immich Drop is a tiny web app that acts as an anonymous upload gateway to your Immich server. You spin it up alongside your Immich instance, and it provides a clean, minimal interface where anyone can drag-and-drop photos and videos. These files are uploaded directly into your Immich library, preserving original dates and handling duplicates intelligently.
