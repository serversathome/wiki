# ![](/mediamanager.png){class="tab-icon"} What is Media Manager?
MediaManager is modern software to manage your TV and movie library. It is designed to be a replacement for Sonarr, Radarr, Overseer, and Jellyseer. It supports TVDB and TMDB for metadata, supports OIDC and OAuth 2.0 for authentication and supports Prowlarr and Jackett. 

# <img src="/docker.png" class="tab-icon"> 1 Â· Deploy Media Manager
```yaml
services:
  mediamanager:
    image: ghcr.io/maxdorninger/mediamanager/mediamanager:latest
    container_name: mediamanager
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - CONFIG_DIR=/app/config
    volumes:
      - /mnt/tank/media:/data/
      - /mnt/tank/configs/mediamanager:/app/config/
      - /mnt/tank/configs/mediamanager/images/:/data/images/
      
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: mediamanager-db
    volumes:
      - /mnt/tank/configs/mediamanager/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -d $${POSTGRES_DB} -U $${POSTGRES_USER}" ]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: MediaManager
      POSTGRES_DB: MediaManager
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: MediaManager

```

Once this is created you need to paste the toml file below to `/mnt/tank/configs/mediamanager` using something like `nano` by entering this command in the TrueNAS shell:
```bash
nano /mnt/tank/configs/mediamanager/config.toml
```
