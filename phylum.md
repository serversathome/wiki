> Phylum does not run as the `apps` user so be sure to create generic permission datasets and give other read, write, and execute access!
{.is-warning}


1. Create a user by running the following command in the TrueNAS shell replacing the `admin@test.com` with your user:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it phylum_server phylum admin user create admin@test.com --no-email
    ```
> 
> The password must be at least 8 characters long
