# ![](/netbird.png){class="tab-icon"} What is Netbird?
NetBird combines a WireGuard®-based overlay network with Zero Trust Network Access, providing a unified open-source platform for reliable and secure connectivity

# 1 · Deploy Netbird
You must first go to [https://netbird.io](https://netbird.io) and click Get Started. After you create an account:
1. Navigate to **Setup Keys** ➡ **Create Setup Keys**
1. Give it a name
1. Switch the Reusable to ON
1. Set the expiry to `0`

# {.tabset}
## <img src="/docker.png" class="tab-icon"> Docker Compose
```yaml

    container_name: netbird
    environment:
      - NB_SETUP_KEY=
    image: netbirdio/netbird:latest

1. Click on "Connect" from the NetBird icon in your system tray
a. Alternatively you can connect through the command line by executing `netbird up --setup-key <key-value>` using the setup key created above

## Mobile

Get the app from your respective app store:
- [Android *Google Play Store*](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.netbird.client)

# 2 · Updating
On linux and mobile, updates are fairly easy through basic `apt upgrade -y` and app store downloads. However on Windows Netbird requires you to redownload the installer. As such, I have made this powershell script that can run as a Scheduled Task:

> Run this as admin!
{.is-warning}


```powershell
# IN the event running scripts is blocked run this command: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force

# NetBird Silent Installer/Updater for All Users (with Auto-Start)
