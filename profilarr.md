| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Name your instance |
| Type | Select type as Radarr or Sonarr |
| Arr Server | Enter the IP of your server using http://|
| API Key | Paste the API key from **Settings** → **General**| 
| Sync Method | Set sync to **On Pull** for full automation [^1]|
| Import as Unique | Use if you have quality profiles from another place like Trash Guides |

> Before sycing your apps change **Propers and Repacks** to **Do not Prefer** in  *advanced* **Settings** → **Media Management** in Radarr in Sonarr
{.is-danger}


## 2.3 Permanently Modifying Profiles
> Any changes you make to the auto-populated definitions will not persist unless you make a commit
{.is-warning}
1. Once your changes are made navigate to **Settings** → **Database** and click the action button to select your modifications
1. Click the ➕ button to Stage your changes
1. Enter the information about your change
1. Click the **Commit** button

# 3 · Media Management

There are some other tweaks which need to be done in Sonarr and Radarr. You can find these in the Advanced section of their respective pages, however, Profilarr can automate that for us.

1. Navigate to the **Media Management** tab
1. Click the **Radarr** subtab
1. Click the **Sync All** button in the top right
1. Repeat this process for Sonarr

# 4 · Anime

To get an anime profile you could either build one yourself through the UI or link to the Servers@Home Profilarr repo. To link, instead of using rhe Dictionarry link from step 2.1.2.a, use the link below:
```bash
https://github.com/serversathome/profilarr
```

# 5 · Future Development
This software is *very* new. As such, there are some changes coming that will improve its usage: 
- The ability to add multiple repos at the same time
- A setting to overwrite external changes with local changes when using auto-pull
- A more fluid way to commit changes with less clicks

[^1]: Automatically syncs selected files whenever the database receives an update. When combined with Auto Pull, allows Profilarr to work completely autonomously
